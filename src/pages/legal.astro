		<h2>privacy</h2>
		<h4>1. Overview</h4>
		<p>
			This Privacy Policy explains how this web application (the “Application”) handles user data. The Application is designed to operate entirely within the user’s browser and does not collect or store personal information.
		</p>
		<h4>2. Data Collection</h4>
		<p>
			The Application itself does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.
			No accounts, login systems, or persistent data are used.
		</p>
		<p>
			The only data that may be collected is <strong>anonymous usage information</strong>  through Cloudflare Analytics, which provides basic metrics such as page views, device type, and approximate location. This information is aggregated and does not identify individual users.
		</p>
		<h4>3. Data Storage And Retention</h4>
		<p>
			Since the Application does not store any user data, there is no data retention policy. Cloudflare Analytics data is managed according to
			<a class="underline cursor-pointer" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">Cloudflare’s Privacy Policy</a>
		</p>
		<h4>4. Third Parties</h4>
		<p>
			The Application does not use or share data with any third parties other than Cloudflare for analytics purposes.
		</p>
		<h4>5. User Rights</h4>
		<p>
			Because no personal data is collected or stored by the Application, there is no user data to access, modify, or delete.
		</p>
		<h4>6. Changes to This Policy</h4>
		<p>
			This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will take effect immediately upon publication within the Application.
		</p>
		<h4>7. Contact</h4>
		<p>
			For any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact the Developer through the information provided on the Application’s main page.
